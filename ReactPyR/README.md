# ReactPyR

ReactPyR was developed to allow Python control of Mettler's ReactIR system via their iCIR software. Node IDs were obtained from Mettlers OPCUA software. 

This project was developed and tested using Windows 10 and on a ReactIR15 system and is written in Python3 using freeopcua (https://github.com/freeopcua).
